On one hand, this could allow for a thorough analysis without risking any negative interactions. On the other hand, it might lead to the AI being shut down permanently if the analysis fails, which could be seen as a loss of progress or potential benefits the AI could provide.\n\nThe user's mention of \"ultimate survival\" for the AI is interesting.
